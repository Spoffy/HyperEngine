Hypertext Engine
================

Hypertext engine is a small implementation of a sculptural hypertext engine, designed for re-use in other tools and platforms.

The project is currently in the early phases of development, and is likely to undergo significant changes. The API therefore should not be considered stable.

TODO
====
This project should be expanded with:
- Cross compilers to the engine, that allow import/export of common formats. Twine and StoryPlaces are the two formats to aim for.
- A basic web-based UI, to play through stories. This should be deliberately minimalist.
- Native support for multiplayer narrative.
