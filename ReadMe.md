HyperEngine
================

HyperEngine is a tiny implementation of a interactive narrative story engine, designed for re-use in other tools and platforms.

The underlying technology is based on Sculptural Hypertext, an idea first talked about by Mark Bernstein in "Card shark and thespis: exotic tools for hypertext narrative", and since further developed by a variety of researchers. More information is available on implementing this idea at "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/421122/1/HT18.pdf".

The project is currently in the early phases of development, and is likely to undergo significant changes. The API therefore should not be considered stable.


Format Support
==============

Support for the following story formats currently exists:

* [StoryPlaces Platform](http://storyplaces.soton.ac.uk/) (http://storyplaces.soton.ac.uk/)


TODO
====
This project should be expanded with:
- Cross compilers to the engine, that allow import/export of common formats. Twine and StoryPlaces are the two formats to aim for.
- A basic web-based UI, to play through stories. This should be deliberately minimalist.
- Native support for multiplayer narrative.
